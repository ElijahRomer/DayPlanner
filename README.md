# DayPlanner
A single day planner that has blocks for each hour of the day, with input fields for user to input day plans, updating based on time of day. Text entries for each hour will persist into new sessions via localStorage. Timeblocks will update upon new session or upon clicking the refresh timeblocks button. The functionality for timeblocks to automatically update at regular intervals was omitted for the risk of erasing user data as it was being typed.

This was a great exercise in utilizing the moment.js data API as well as expanding my knowledge on the capability of jQuery.
